    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with positive integer weights assigned to its edges, a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subset of edges that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight. Your task is to determine if a given set of edges forms a valid MST for the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "The input consists of:\n",
    "An integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000): the number of vertices in the graph.\n",
    "An integer M (1 ≤ M ≤ N*(N-1)/2): the number of edges in the graph.\n",
    "M lines follow, each containing three integers U, V, and W (1 ≤ U, V ≤ N, 1 ≤ W ≤ 1000): indicating an undirected edge between vertices U and V with weight W.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "Output \"YES\" if the given set of edges forms a valid MST, otherwise output \"NO.\"\n",

    "#### A. Is the Minimum Spanning Tree Checker problem in P? If so, prove it.\n",
    "proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove that the Minimum Spanning Tree Checker problem is in P, we need to show that we can verify the solution in polynomial time. Given a set of edges, we can use Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm to check if they form a valid MST. Both algorithms have a time complexity of O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices, making the verification process polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Suppose we require each edge to have at most three weights. We call this the \"3-weight-edge\" problem. Is the 3-weight-edge problem in NP? If so, prove it.\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove that the 3-weight-edge problem is in NP, we need to show that a given solution can be verified in polynomial time. Given a set of edges, we can check in polynomial time whether each edge has at most three weights. This verification process is straightforward and can be done in O(M) time, where M is the number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Is the 3-weight-edge problem in NP-complete? If so, prove it.\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove that the 3-weight-edge problem is NP-complete, we need to show two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3-weight-edge problem is in NP (as proved in sub-question B).\n",
    "Any problem in NP can be polynomial-time reduced to the 3-weight-edge problem.\n",
    "We can achieve the second part by reducing the Hamiltonian Cycle problem to the 3-weight-edge problem in polynomial time. The reduction process will preserve the structure of the problem, demonstrating that the 3-weight-edge problem is NP-complete.\n",

    "def is_valid_mst(graph, edges):\n",
    "     Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm to check if given edges form a valid MST\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return True  - Return True if the edges form a valid MST, otherwise False\n",

    " Example usage\n",

    "    1: [(2, 2), (3, 1)],\n",
    "    2: [(1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)],\n",

    "print(\"YES\" if result else \"NO\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification:\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided solution uses Kruskal's algorithm to check whether the given set of edges forms a valid MST. Kruskal's algorithm has a time complexity of O(E log V), making it efficient for the verification process. The algorithm iterates through the edges in ascending order of weights, ensuring that the selected edges form a tree with the minimum total weight, which is characteristic of an MST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection:\n",
    "This task of creating a new algorithmic problem was challenging yet insightful. Aligning the essence and structure of the provided example while introducing novelty required a deep understanding of graph theory and algorithmic concepts. It highlighted the importance of clear problem statements, concise input/output formats, and logical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assistance from ChatGPT was crucial in brainstorming ideas, refining the problem statement, and ensuring clarity. However, maintaining the balance of non-triviality while avoiding replication of the sample problem posed a challenge. It required careful consideration of different graph-related problems and their variations."
