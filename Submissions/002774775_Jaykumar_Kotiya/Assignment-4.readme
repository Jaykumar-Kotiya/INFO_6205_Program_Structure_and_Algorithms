Assignment-4 "Summary of Assignment 4"

# Question-1

The process of designing sub-questions and providing proofs deepened my understanding of problem complexity 
classes, such as P, NP, and NP-complete. It also emphasized the significance of well-defined and verifiable 
sub-problems in algorithmic research.

In conclusion, this task enhanced my problem design skills, honed my ability to articulate complex concepts, 
and reinforced the importance of reflective thinking in algorithmic problem-solving.

# Question-2

The process highlighted the importance of problem clarity and originality. It was essential to craft a 
non-trivial problem that doesn't mimic existing ones. The reflection underscores the significance of 
leveraging tools like ChatGPT in problem design, acknowledging both the assistance and challenges encountered.

# Question-3

I learned the importance of framing problems that challenge participants while avoiding unnecessary complexity. 
Balancing originality, clarity, and relevance is crucial for creating engaging algorithmic problems. This task 
reinforced the significance of iterative refinement and thoughtful consideration in problem design.

# Question-4

This task reinforced the importance of problem design in algorithmic scenarios. It emphasized the need for 
creativity, clarity, and a deep understanding of computational complexity. The process, coupled with the 
assistance of ChatGPT, provided insights into effective problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

# Question-5

The use of ChatGPT greatly assisted in refining the problem statement and structuring the questions. Designing 
sub-questions and proofs enhanced my understanding of algorithmic problem-solving. Overall, this experience 
highlighted the delicate balance between creativity, clarity, and complexity in problem design.
